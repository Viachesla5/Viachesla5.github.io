                    Virtual reality is used as a training aid in many sports such as golf, athletics, skiing, cycling etc. It is used as an aid to measuring athletic performance as well as analyzing technique and is designed to help with both of these. It also used in clothing/equipment design and as part of the drive to improve the audience&#39;s experience. Virtual reality has also been used to improve the audience&#39;s experience of a sporting event. Some systems allow the audience to walkthrough a stadium or other sporting location, which helps them when purchasing a ticket to an event.

                    The athlete uses this technology to fine tune certain aspects of their performance, for example, a golfer looking to improve their swing or a track cyclist wanting to go faster in the individual pursuit. Three dimensional systems can pinpoint aspects of an athlete&#39;s performance which require changing, for example, their biomechanics or technique.

In the same NBC Sports feature, Horowitz notes that advancements in VR have more or less made actual and simulated realities virtually indistinguishable. By blurring the lines that separate the real from the virtual, VR has now become &#34;the ideal means of supplementing work on the field, on the rink, on the court, to further athletes&#39; skills and knowledge of the game. &#34;
